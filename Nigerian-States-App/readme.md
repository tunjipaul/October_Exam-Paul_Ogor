Login Page:

Collect: Email and Password
Verify credentials against database
Redirect to dashboard on successful login
Show error message for invalid credentials
2. States Dashboard (Main Page - After Login)

Database Schema
Environment Variables (.env file)
dbuser=your_mysql_username
dbpassword=your_mysql_password
dbhost=localhost
dbport=3306
dbname=nigerian_states_db
Database Tables (Created via SQLAlchemy)
Table 1: users

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Table 2: states

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS states (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    capital VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    region VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    slogan VARCHAR(200),
    population INT,
    landmarks TEXT
);
API Endpoints (FastAPI)
Authentication
POST /api/signup - Register new user

Request body (Pydantic model): {full_name: str, email: str, password: str}
Response: {message: "User created successfully", user_id: 1}
POST /api/login - Login user

Request body (Pydantic model): {email: str, password: str}
Response: {message: "Login successful", user: {id, full_name, email}}
States
GET /api/states - Get all Nigerian states
Response: Array of all states with their details
Steps to Complete
Part A: Backend Setup (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + MySQL)
Environment Setup:

Install dependencies: fastapi, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, pymysql, bcrypt, python-dotenv, pydantic
Create .env file with database credentials:
dbuser=root
dbpassword=your_password
dbhost=localhost
dbport=3306
dbname=nigerian_states_db
Database Configuration (database.py):

from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pymysql.constants import CLIENT
import os

load_dotenv()

db_url = f"mysql+pymysql://{os.getenv('dbuser')}:{os.getenv('dbpassword')}@{os.getenv('dbhost')}:{os.getenv('dbport')}/{os.getenv('dbname')}"

engine = create_engine(
    db_url,
    connect_args={"client_flag": CLIENT.MULTI_STATEMENTS}
)

session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
db = session()

# Create tables
create_table_query = text("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS states (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    capital VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    region VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    slogan VARCHAR(200),
    population INT,
    landmarks TEXT
);
""")

db.execute(create_table_query)
db.commit()
print("Tables created successfully!")
Pydantic Models (in main.py):

Define request/response models using Pydantic BaseModel
Example:
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr

class SignupRequest(BaseModel):
    full_name: str
    email: EmailStr
    password: str

class LoginRequest(BaseModel):
    email: EmailStr
    password: str

class UserResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    full_name: str
    email: str
FastAPI Application (main.py):

Import FastAPI, database, bcrypt, Pydantic models
Create FastAPI app instance
Implement all API endpoints using Pydantic for validation
API Endpoints Implementation:

Signup endpoint (POST /api/signup):

Use Pydantic model to validate request body (SignupRequest)
Check if email already exists using SQL query
Hash password using bcrypt: bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt())
Insert new user into database using text() and SQL INSERT
Return success message with user_id
Login endpoint (POST /api/login):

Use Pydantic model to validate request body (LoginRequest)
Query database for user by email using text() and SQL SELECT
Verify password hash using bcrypt: bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), stored_hash)
Return user data (id, full_name, email) on success
Return error message if credentials invalid
Get all states (GET /api/states):

Query all states from database using text() and SQL SELECT
Convert results to list of dictionaries
Return list of all states with complete information
Populate States Data:

Use text() with INSERT statements or loop through the states data
Use the complete data provided below
Part B: Frontend Setup (React)
React Setup:

Create React app using Vite: npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react
Install dependencies: react-router-dom
Set up routing for different pages (Signup, Login, Dashboard)
Build Components:

Signup Component:

Form with fields: Full Name, Email, Password
Validate email format (contains @)
Validate password length (minimum 6 characters)
Submit form data to backend /api/signup
Show success message and redirect to login
Show error message if signup fails
Login Component:

Form with fields: Email, Password
Submit credentials to backend /api/login
Store user data in component state or localStorage
Redirect to dashboard on success
Show error message for invalid credentials
Dashboard Component:

Fetch all states from /api/states when component loads
Display states in a responsive grid (3-4 cards per row)
Each card shows: State name, capital, region, slogan, population, landmarks
Include logout button at top
StateCard Component:

Reusable component to display state information
Props: state data (name, capital, region, slogan, population, landmarks)
Styling (CSS):

Create professional and clean design
Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layouts
Style forms with proper spacing and labels
Style state cards with borders, shadows, and hover effects
Make the application responsive for mobile devices
Use consistent colors and fonts throughout
Navigation:

Use React Router for page navigation
Route setup:
/ - Signup page
/login - Login page
/dashboard - States dashboard

Do NOT add CORS middleware - Not required for this exam
Hash passwords before storing (never store plain text passwords)
Make sure both frontend and backend run without errors
Use meaningful variable and function names
Comment your code where necessary
Ensure all 37 states are in your database
